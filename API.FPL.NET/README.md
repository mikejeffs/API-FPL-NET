# 28/09/2019 - Status
## Incomplete - UserEntries still requires the get cup history endpoint, as well as post endpoints for making transfers, substitutions, etc.
## Currently working on a login endpoint to authenticate the user when trying to access endpoints that require authorisation. Error being ran into at the moment is related to csfr token validation.
